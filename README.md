# Object Oriented Programming

- **What is an object?**
  - An object is an instance of class.
  - An object is a real world entity that has state and behaviour.
  - An object is also known as runtime entity, because it is created at runtime.

- **What is a class?**
  - A class is a blueprint of an object.
  - `class Student{      
        public:        
           string name;
           int id;     
   };                   `

- **C++ constructor**
  - Constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.

  **Types of Constructors**
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor

- **C++ Destructor**
  - Destructor destructs the object, it works oposite to the constructor.


  ## Features of OOPS

- ###    [Inheritance](https://github.com/0-jagadeesh-0/OOPS#inheritance)
- ###    [Polymorphism](https://github.com/0-jagadeesh-0/OOPS/#polymorphism)
- ###    [Encapsulation](https://github.com/0-jagadeesh-0/OOPS#encapsulation)
- ###    [Abstraction](https://github.com/0-jagadeesh-0/OOPS#abstraction)


  ### Inheritance

> ***The process in which an object acquires all the properties and behaviour from the parent object automatically.***

  **Advantages**
  - Code Reusability.

  **Types of Inheritance**
  1. Single Inheritance
  2. Multiple Inheritance
  3. Hierarchial Inheritance
  4. Multilevel Inheritance
  5. Hybrid Inheritance



  ### Polymorphism


  ### Encapsulation



  ### Abstraction
