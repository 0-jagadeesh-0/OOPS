# Object Oriented Programming


## What is Object Oriented Programming?
   Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of *objects*, which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

## Advantages
- OOPs is very helpful in solving very complex level of problems.
- Highly complex programs can be created, handled, and maintained easily using object-oriented programming.
- OOPs, promote code reuse, thereby reducing redundancy.
- OOPs also helps to hide the unnecessary details with the help of Data Abstraction.
- OOPs, are based on a bottom-up approach, unlike the Structural programming paradigm, which uses a top-down approach.
- Polymorphism offers a lot of flexibility in OOPs
