# OOP Fundamentals

## What is an object?
  - An object is an instance of class.
  - An object is a real world entity that has state and behaviour.
  - An object is also known as runtime entity, because it is created at runtime.

## What is a class?
  - A class is a blueprint of an object.
  ``` 
   class Student{      
        public:        
           string name;
           int id;     
   };                   
   ```
## Constructor and Destructor

- **C++ constructor**
  - Constructor is a special method which is invoked automatically at the time of object creation.
  - It is called constructor because it constructs the values of data members of the class.

  **Types of Constructors**
  - Default Constructor
  - Parameterized Constructor

- **C++ Destructor**
  - Destructor destructs the object, it works oposite to the constructor.
